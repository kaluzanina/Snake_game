# 🐍 Snake Game

**Snake Game** is a classic arcade game where you control a snake and collect food to earn points. Each piece of food makes the snake grow, making the game progressively harder. Watch out for collisions with walls and the snake's tail!

## 🎮 Features
- **Controls**: Use the arrow keys `Up`, `Down`, `Left`, `Right` to navigate the snake.
- **End Game**: Pressing `Escape` immediately exits the game.
- **Restart After Loss**: Pressing `Enter` resets the game and allows you to start again.
- **Scoring**: Each piece of food adds a point and extends the snake.
- **Dynamic Difficulty**: The longer the snake grows, the more challenging the game becomes.

## 🛠️ System Requirements
- Python 3.8 or newer
